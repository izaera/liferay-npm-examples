# billboard.js-example

This example demonstrates a simple portlet using [billboard.js](https://naver.github.io/billboard.js/),
which is pulled from the NPM registry.

To see this example in action you need to:

1) Configure `liferay.workspace.home.dir` in `../../gradle.properties` (set it
   to point to your Liferay Portal `bundles` directory).

2) Run `../../gradlew deploy`.

3) Add a '**Liferay NPM billboard.js Example**' portlet to your page.
